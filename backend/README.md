# Backend Setup

Download dependencies with `yarn i`

Start backend in development mode with `yarn dev`

Create a .env file in the root of the backend folder and create variables for:
```
PORT
TWITTER_API_KEY
TWITTER_API_SECRET
TWITTER_API_BASE_ENDPOINT
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN
```  
Obviously you will need your own twitter application for the key related variables
